Major Project - Arithmetic Circuit Homomorphic Encryption
=========================================================

An extension of an ongoing research project. We are tasked to conduct research on Homomorphic Encryption and find ways to implement parallel processing by using programs such as MPI or OpenMP. In this iteration of the project, we successfully coded the 32, 64, 128bits computations using MPI. Moreover, we had also integrated both the OpenMP and MPI codes into one using Paramiko SSH and an entire different set of codes designed for MPI. Several issues and difficulties were faced during this project such as the lack of memory, processors as well as knowledge, but my teammate and I managed to pull through and are delighted with the results.

Possible Future Implementations
===============================

- 256 bit computations (MPI) 
- 64 bit and over Multiplication (MPI)
- Implementation of GUI
(More details in issues)
