MP-ACHE
=======

An extension of an ongoing research project. We are tasked to conduct research on Homomorphic Encryption and find ways to implement parallel processing by using programs such as MPI or OpenMP. In this iteration of the project, we successfully coded the 32, 64, 128bits computations using MPI. Moreover, we had also integrated both the OpenMP and MPI codes into one. Several issues and difficulties were faced during this project but my teammate and I are delighted with the results.

Installations and dependecies guide can be seen on our senior's github.
